        <SectionHeader heading="WHY DONATE YOUR EMBRYOS TO THE NEDC" />

        <p>
          Many donate embryos through the NEDC mainly because we are a well-established organization
          with long-term success in providing safe storage for all embryos. We also have many years
          of experience in facilitating successful embryo adoptions with recipient couples who have
          met all criteria to be eligible to adopt embryos that were donated both openly and
          anonymously.
        </p>
        <p>There are many other reasons to donate your embryos through the NEDC.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Experience matters!</b> We are the largest embryo donation program in the country and
            have received and cared for over 2500 sets of frozen embryos. We have experienced
            embryologists who arrange for shipping and care after arrival. Our embryologists have
            over 45 years of combined experience in IVF. They can confidently handle the thawing of
            embryos frozen by a wide variety of protocols as we have received embryos from IVF
            centers all over the country.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Values matter!</b> Itâ€™s all right there in our Mission and Value Statement:
            <a href="https://www.embryodonation.org/about/">
              (https://www.embryodonation.org/about/)
            </a>
            . All of us here at the NEDC value the human lives which are your embryos. We treat them
            with the care and respect they deserve. We are dedicated to finding the best possible
            homes for the children through the donation of your embryos. Therefore, we have age,
            weight and health restrictions on our adopting couples, and we also require a home study
            of adopting couples so you can be certain your embryos are going to the best possible
            family.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Screening matters!</b> We medically screen couples to ensure that your embryos will
            have a high likelihood of implanting and ultimately resulting in a live birth. This
            necessitates that we must exclude some couples who have social or medical conditions
            such as nicotine, drug, or alcohol addiction, a history of recurrent implantation
            failure with previous embryo transfers, or serious gynecologic conditions such as
            endometriosis, fibroids, or adenomyosis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Flexibility matters!</b> We realize that not all couples are comfortable with all
            forms of embryo donation. Therefore, we offer the option of donating your embryos both
            anonymously and openly. Furthermore, open donation can be tailored to your individual
            needs and desires, with all degrees of information sharing possible, making you feel
            more comfortable with your decision. We have a dedicated Social Work group (Flourish
            Consulting, LLC) who reviews all home studies, and mediates Open Donation Agreements
            (ODAs). This allows for a seamless experience for you without having to resort to
            expensive attorneys or other intermediaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cost matters!</b> There are NO FEES to you for donating your embryos. And once we
            have received them from your clinic, you will no longer be liable for storage costs from
            them. Likewise, we do not charge you storage fees, nor do we charge you shipping fees
            for moving your embryos to the NEDC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Success matters!</b> We have outstanding staff, which has resulted in us being
            blessed with the highest embryo adoption pregnancy rates in the nation as well as the
            most births from embryo donation in the entire world. We have now facilitated over 1200
            births in our 18-year history.
