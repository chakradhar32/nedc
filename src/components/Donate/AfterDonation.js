        <p>
          <b>OVERVIEW:</b> It may take several months or several years to find a recipient couple
          for your embryos. We have streamlined the process for recipients by allowing them to
          choose certain characteristics in potential donors by using filters in our donor database.
          Therefore, depending on your unique profile, it may take a lesser or longer amount of time
          to match.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your embryos are matched, you will be notified if you are an open donor. However, if
          you prefer NOT to be notified, we will respect your wishes. If at any time you have
          questions about the status of your embryos, you can always call or email us.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of closed/ anonymous donation, you will receive no further information from
          us. If you do wish to be notified about the birth of a child from your embryos, with no
          identifying information given, please let us know and we will attempt to notify you. You
          are always welcome to call or email to check on the status of the embryos you have
          donated.
        </p>
        <p>
          For open donation, you will have ongoing contact through Flourish Consulting LLC. If you
          become aware of any medical or genetic conditions in you or your children after donation,
          we request that you notify Flourish Consulting (for open donors) or us so that we can
          inform the recipient couple. This will of course be done in an anonymous manner for closed
          embryo donations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>ANONYMOUS DONATION:</b> Once you complete the donation process, we will begin sharing
          your profile to couples as they become eligible to adopt embryos. You are welcome to
          contact us at any time and inquire about your embryos. We can reveal if your embryos have
          been adopted, if there was a birth, and the gender of the baby (or babies). No identifying
          factors (name, place of birth, etc.) will be revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing that really helps our adoptive couples make their decision when viewing donor
          profiles is seeing pictures of a baby or child that would be a genetic sibling to the
          embryos that were donated and/or pictures of the parents of the embryos. All pictures that
          are added to a profile are kept secure and are only viewed by potential adoptive couples,
          who are given a passcode. You can send pictures by either email or mail if you would like
          those added to your profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide the NEDC is the right fit for your embryo donation, please know we will do
          everything possible to give your embryos a chance at life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>OPEN DONATION:</b> Once you have completed the donation process, we will then begin
          sharing your profile with recipient couples. Once a potential adoptive couple chooses your
          profile, we will then reach out to you via email with the prospective adoptive couple’s
          profile information, letter, and photo. At that time, you can choose to accept or decline
          this couple. If you choose to accept the recipient couple, your profile will then be sent
          to one of our social workers at Flourish Consulting Services, LLC. All final terms for the
          embryo adoption will be mediated and set by our social worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have witnessed many precious relationships develop and many beautiful stories unfold
          among our donor and recipient couples. We are happy you chose us to be part of your
          journey to share this gift of hope and life with other couples. We understand that this
          process can be emotional and challenging for our donor couples. We are here to help guide
          you and support you through the matching and mediation process. Again, we are aware that
          not all donor and recipient couples are compatible with each other. Rest assured you will
          have the option to accept or decline a recipient couples’ request to adopt your embryo(s).
          We never want a donor couple to feel pressure during the matching and mediation process.
          We want you to feel supported and have the opportunity to choose a couple with whom you
          are comfortable sharing this gift. We know many donor couples have experienced a long and
          sometimes difficult infertility journey. You have now chosen to share hope and life with
          recipient couples. Keep in mind that many of our recipient couples have also experienced a
          long, difficult road to reach this point in their journey. This sometimes includes many
          disappointments and loss. It can be disheartening to recipient couples when we advise them
          that a donor couple has declined their request to adopt their embryos. Therefore, we try
          to give our donor couples plenty of opportunity to communicate any questions, concerns, or
          specific information that would be helpful in our efforts to match you with prospective
          adoptive couples. Some couples have strong values, beliefs, and opinions that could
          potentially affect their decision to accept or decline a recipient couple. A willingness
          to share this information is helpful to us as we work to match donor and recipient couples
          that are most compatible with each other. This information could also be helpful in our
          efforts to help prevent recipient couples from experiencing any unnecessary
          disappointments and/or feelings of rejection. We ultimately want both couples to have a
          positive experience during this process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also want to take this time to remind you that all NEDC Embryo Profiles must remain
          active and available for adoption. Our mission is to provide all embryos donated a chance
          at life. Unfortunately, we have had a few cases in which donor couples have chosen open
          donation and then proceeded with actions that made it difficult to consider their embryo
          profile as active and available for adoption. We would like to provide you with a few
          suggestions as we move forward in this process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will contact you by email and/or phone when a recipient couple chooses your profile.
            Please remember to inform us of any changes in your contact information (address, email,
            phone number, etc.). We will give you ample time to review and discuss the recipient
            couple’s information. Please let us know if you have questions or concerns about any of
            the information that we provide to you. All NEDC recipient couples must meet all of our
            program requirements. All are thoroughly screened and must pass a legal home study. If
            you ultimately decide to decline the recipient couple, it is helpful if you can provide
            us any feedback or if there was a specific reason that led to your decision to decline
            the couple.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              As stated in your signed consent to donate embryos, if you are matched with and
              decline (5) FIVE proposed recipient couples without feedback, you will be charged $500
              per year for storage fees, subject to change.
            </b>{' '}
            If this were to occur, we would also encourage you to consider making alternate storage
            arrangements for your embryos.
