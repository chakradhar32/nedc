        <p>Can I adopt embryos of a different ethnicity?</p>
        <p>Can I adopt embryos with known potential for genetic or other abnormalities?</p>
        <p>Can I select the sex of the embryo or embryos I adopt?</p>
        <p>Will we need to travel?</p>

        <p>Will the genetic parents know our or the childâ€™s identity? </p>

        <p>What are my chances for a successful pregnancy?</p>
        <p>How many embryos will be transferred to my uterus?</p>
        <p>Is there a chance for multiple births?</p>
