          Want to bless families and children by giving life and hope in a way that outlasts your
          own lifetime? Prayerfully consider a legacy gift to the NEDC. There are a variety of ways
          you can help fund the NEDCâ€™s work for decades to come:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Include the NEDC in your will.</b> Have your attorney add a charitable bequest for the NEDC to
          your will or estate plan. You can direct how you would like us to use your gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Designate the NEDC as an insurance beneficiary.</b> Designate the NEDC to receive all or part
          of the proceeds of a life insurance policy. To do this, just ask your insurance company
          for a beneficiary designation form.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Include the NEDC in your retirement plan.</b> Designate the NEDC to receive part or all of
          what remains of your retirement plan after your death. This is a tax-efficient way for you
          to bless others and ensure your money has the greatest possible impact. For instance,
          heirs of a large estate may receive as little as one-third of a retirement plan after
          estate and income taxes are factored in. However, because charities do not pay income
          taxes on donations received, distributions to the NEDC will not be taxed as income.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Set up a trust benefiting the NEDC.</b> Establishing a charitable remainder trust can provide
          income and tax benefits to you during your lifetime, and then pass those benefits on to
          the NEDC after your death. We would be glad to confidentially discuss with you the tax and
          income benefits available to you and your family through a charitable remainder trust.
        </p>
        <p>
